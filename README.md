# Nextcloud app development example

This is an example nextcloud app development setup.

This repository features a [Docker Compose setup](dev/compose.yaml) to develop against a specific Nextcloud version and supports
hot module replacement of the app's frontend (Vue.js) components.

## Building the app

1. Install php dependencies:
    ```
    make composer
    ```
2. Install npm dependencies:
    ```
    npm ci
    ```

## Run the app

1. Start the webpack dev server (see [package.json](package.json) from your development IDE:
    ```
   npm run serve
    ```
2. Start the Nextcloud Docker environment from the `dev` folder:
    ```
    docker compose up -d
    ```

This starts the [nextcloud-docker-dev](https://github.com/juliushaertl/nextcloud-docker-dev) container.

## Enable apps

In order for Hot module replacement (HMR) to work the [HMR Enabler](https://github.com/nextcloud/hmr_enabler) app
which is already mounted into the container needs to be enabled.

1. Login to `http://localhost:8080` with user `admin` and password `admin`.
2. Go to _Apps_ and **HMR Enabler** and the **Template App**

You can now go the App's navigation item at the top to see the example app from the
[Nextcloud App Generator](https://apps.nextcloud.com/developer/apps/generate).

Changes to the Vue.js frontend code should now trigger the webpack-dev-server to rebuild the code and the browser to
reload the content.
